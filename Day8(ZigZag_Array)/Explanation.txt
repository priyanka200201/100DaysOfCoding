Topic: Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion

Question: Given an array arr of distinct elements of size N, the task is to rearrange the elements of the array in a zig-zag fashion so that the 
converted array should be in the below form: 

The idea of this problem to make it zig zag is by placing the larger element in the even index
 between two smaller elements which are on the odd index.

arr[0] < arr[1]  > arr[2] < arr[3] > arr[4] < . . . . arr[n-2] < arr[n-1] > arr[n]. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= Arri <= 106

Example 1:

Test Case 1:

N = 7
Arr[] = {4, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1}
Output: 3 7 4 8 2 6 1
Explanation: 3 < 7 > 4 < 8 > 2 < 6 > 1

Test Case 2:
Input:
N = 4
Arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 2}
Output: 1 4 2 3
Explanation: 1 < 4 > 2 < 3

Test Case 3: 
Input N=0
Arr[]={}
No operations
Explanation: Array is null so no operations can be done.

Test Case 4:
Repeated elements in the array
Print repeated elements present in the array

Test Case 5:
Input N=1
Only one elemement is present in the array
Output: No operations can be done
