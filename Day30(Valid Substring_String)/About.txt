//https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/valid-substring0624/0

Given a string S consisting only of opening and closing parenthesis 'ie '('  and ')', 
find out the length of the longest valid(well-formed) parentheses substring.
NOTE: Length of the smallest valid substring ( ) is 2.

Test Case 1:

Input: S = "(()("
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid 
substring is "()". Length = 2.

Test Case 2:

Input: S = "()(())("
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest valid 
substring is "()(())". Length = 6.

Test Case 3:

Input: S= ""
Output: 0
Explanation: No String


Expected Time Complexity:O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)   


Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 105
