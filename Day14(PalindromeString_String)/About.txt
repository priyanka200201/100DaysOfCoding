Test Case 1:

Input: S = "abba"
Output: 1
Explanation: S is a palindrome

Test Case 2:

Input: S = "abc" 
Output: 0
Explanation: S is not a palindrome

Test Case 3:

Input: S=''
Output: No String available


Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Complete the function isPalindrome()which accepts string S and returns an integer value 1 or 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Length of S)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
