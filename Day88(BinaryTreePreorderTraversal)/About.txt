QUESTION: Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
//https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/description/

Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Test Case 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Test Case 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []

Test Case 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
