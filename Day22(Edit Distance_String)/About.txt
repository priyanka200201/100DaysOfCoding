//https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/edit-distance3702/1?page=1&category[]=Strings&sortBy=submissions

Given two strings s and t. Return the minimum number of operations required to convert s to t.
The possible operations are permitted:

Insert a character at any position of the string.
Remove any character from the string.
Replace any character from the string with any other character.
 

Test Case 1:

Input: 
s = "geek", t = "gesek"
Output: 1
Explanation: One operation is required 
inserting 's' between two 'e's of str1.

Test Case 2:

Input : 
s = "gfg", t = "gfg"
Output: 
0
Explanation: Both strings are same.
 


Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|*|t|)
Expected Space Complexity: O(|s|*|t|)


Constraints:
1 ≤ Length of both strings ≤ 100
Both the strings are in lowercase.
