QUESTION: Self Crossing
//https://leetcode.com/problems/self-crossing/description/

Given an array of integers distance.
You start at point (0,0) on an X-Y plane and you move distance[0] meters to the north, then distance[1] meters to the west, 
distance[2] meters to the south, distance[3] meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction
 changes counter-clockwise.

Return true if your path crosses itself, and false if it does not.

Test Case 1:

Input: distance = [2,1,1,2]
Output: true

Test Case 2:

Input: distance = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

Test Case 3:

Input: distance = [1,1,1,1]
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= distance.length <= 105
1 <= distance[i] <= 105
