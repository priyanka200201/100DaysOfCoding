QUESTION:  Longest Common Prefix in an Array
//https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-common-prefix-in-an-array5129/1?page=1&category[]=Strings&curated[]=1&sortBy=submissions

Given a array of N strings, find the longest common prefix among all strings present in the array.

Test Case 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {geeksforgeeks, geeks, geek,geezer}
Output: gee
Explanation: "gee" is the longest common
prefix in all the given strings.

Test Case 2:

Input: 
N = 2
arr[] = {hello, world}
Output: -1
Explanation: There's no common prefix
in the given strings.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.
 Your task is to complete the function longestCommonPrefix() which takes the string array arr[] and its size N as inputs and 
 returns the longest common prefix common in all the strings in the array. If there's no prefix common in all the strings, return "-1".


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*max(|arri|)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(max(|arri|)) for result.


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 103
1 ≤ |arri| ≤ 103
