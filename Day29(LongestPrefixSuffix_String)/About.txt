//https:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-prefix-suffix2527/1?page=2&category[]=Strings&sortBy=submissions

Given a string of characters, find the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix.

NOTE: Prefix and suffix can be overlapping but they should not be equal to the entire string.

Test Case 1:

Input: s = "abab"
Output: 2
Explanation: "ab" is the longest proper 
prefix and suffix. 


Test Case 2:

Input: s = "aaaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: "aaa" is the longest proper 
prefix and suffix. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|s|)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105
s contains lower case English alphabets
