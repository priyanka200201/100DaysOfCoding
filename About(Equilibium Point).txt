Question :
Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibium Point in the array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Note: Retun the index of Equilibrium point. (1-based index)

Task:The task is to complete the function equilibriumPoint() which takes the array and
 n as input parameters and returns the point of equilibrium. Return -1 if no such point exists.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106
1 <= A[i] <= 108


Test Case 1
Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 
Output: 3 
Explanation:  
equilibrium point is at position 3 
as elements before it (1+3) = 
elements after it (2+2). 
 

Test Case 2
Input:
n = 1
A[] = {1}
Output: 1
Explanation:
Since its the only element hence
its the only equilibrium point.

Test Case 3:
Input:
n=0
There will be no elements to perform operation

Test Case 4:
Input:
n=2
For 2 elements we will not be able to find equilibrium point except for array with values like {1,0} and {0,1}
